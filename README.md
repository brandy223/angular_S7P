# AngularS7P
    * Project description

- Our project uses a video game API that allows us to retrieve and display video games on different pages.
There's a 
- classic home page
- Games, which lists all games with pagination and the possibility of searching by name and sorting by platform, publisher or genre. When a game is clicked, the game details appear; if the back arrow is clicked, sorting persists.
- Platform, listing available platforms and number of games.
