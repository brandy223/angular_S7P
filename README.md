# AngularS7P

<br>

## Project description

This repo is an angular 16 project for the web development course.
Its goal is to create a website using Angular and make use of an API.
Our project uses a video game API that allows us to retrieve and display video games on different pages. There's :
- A classic home page
- Games, which lists all games with pagination and the possibility of searching by name and sorting by platform, publisher or genre. When a game is clicked, the game details appear; if the back arrow is clicked, sorting persists.
- Platforms, listing available platforms and number of games.

To get the project files :
`git clone https://github.com/brandy223/angular_S7P.git`

<u>Then :</u>
- `npm i` : To install all the dependencies
- `ng serve` : To run the project
